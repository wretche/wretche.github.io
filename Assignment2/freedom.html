		The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties about the furture, ambitions for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance.<br>-- Anthony Demello

		Not having to worry about repaying credit cards, car loans, or student loans is true freedom.<br>--Shane Baxter
